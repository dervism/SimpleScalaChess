SimpleScalaChess
================

A very simple implementation of a chess game using the alpha-beta algorithm.
The original framework is written by Kevin Knight in Common Lisp and later migrated to Java by Mark Watson.

This project will migrate the code to Scala.

The project is a work in progress! The application works, however, it is extremely slow at the moment.

How to run:

- Download SBT and place it in the root folder
- Open a command window and then execute SBT with the 'sbt' command
- Wait while SBT downloads libraries and dependencies
- Run the application with the 'run' command
